• Developed a deep learning solution for binary classification of facial images using the state-of-
the-art Xception model, achieving high accuracy and robustness. 
• Implemented a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline with TensorFlow's 
ImageDataGenerator, including data augmentation, scaling, and cropping, to ensure model 
generalization across diverse datasets. 
• Orchestrated end-to-end model development, training and evaluation.
